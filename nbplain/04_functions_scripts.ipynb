    "A function can be thought of as a _subroutine_ or _proceedure_ that we want to perform: functions take in a selection of values as _inputs_ and perform some routine on them to produce _outputs_.\n",

    "From this point on, MATLAB will interpret all the commands we enter as being part of the function definition.\n",
    "The `end` keyword is used to tell MATLAB when to _stop_ reading the commands we enter as being part of the function - the `end` keyword is used in many other places too, so it's good practice to put a comment after it saying _what_ the `end` statement is ending when it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `function` keyword comes a list of all the output arguments - in this case, we are providing two outputs arguments imaginatively called `output_1` and `output_2`.\n",
    "We will need to define these variables inside the function, and then when the function runs these values will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes an `=` followed by the name of the function we are defining; in this case we are calling our function `fun_name`.\n",
    "This is also the name that we should save the file containing the function as (`fun_name.m`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Last on the top line are the input arguments in round brackets - in this case we are providing three inputs to the function.\n",
    "These are values that the function will be provided with when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the first line and the `end` keyword, you would type out the commands that the function would run to take it's input arguments and produce the output arguments.\n",
    "It is good practice to leave a brief and detailed description of the function in comments after the first line of the file, to remind yourself or someone else using your code what the function is actually doing."

    " - `tRange` is an array of two values, the start and final times. So `tRange = [start end]` is how this should look, with `start`$=t_0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The outputs are `tVals` and `yVals`.\n",

    " 1. Write a function `log_growth(N,r,K)` that takes as inputs a (vector of) population $N$, and scalar growth rate $r$ and population capacity $K$. This function should return (a vector of) the value of the right hand side of the logistic growth equation.\n",
    " 1. Write a script to solve the logistic growth equation using `ode45`, from the initial time $t_0=0$. You have diligently performed some field experiments and have determined that the duck population of Bath University is currently $20$, the growth rate is $0.15$, and carrying capacity of the campus is $50$ ducks. Run your model to a final time of $t=30$. Save the outputs of `ode45` to a pair of variables called `tVals` and `NVals`.\n",
    " 1. After the call to `ode45` in your script, plot the solution by adding the following commands to your script:\n",
