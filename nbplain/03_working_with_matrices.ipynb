    "\n",
    "There are some functions in MATLAB that allow us to extract parts of matrices quickly.\n",
    "`diag` is one of these functions (yes, the same `diag` as in the previous lesson); when we give it a matrix argument it returns a vector that contains the diagonal entries of the matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Isolation via \"Slicing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we may not only be interested in the diagonal or triangular parts of an array, but instead might be looking for a \"sub-block\" of a matrix or some important components of a vector.\n",
    "In these cases, we can use a technique called _index slicing_ to aid us.\n",
    "This technique allows us to extract multiple entries at once, and also allows us to assign them at once too!\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"slice\" an array, we use a colon (`:`) when we try to access the values stored in an array.\n",
    "- If we want _all_ the entries along one dimension of the array, we just put a colon where we would normally put the index.\n",
